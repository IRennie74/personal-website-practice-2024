About This Project

This website is a small project I built in 2024 to showcase some of my front‑end development skills. The theme is intentionally light‑hearted and fun, but beneath that is a clean demonstration of my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript abilities.

While the site itself is fairly simple, it highlights my understanding of core web‑building concepts, responsive layout techniques, and basic design principles. It serves as a snapshot of where my skills were at the time and reflects my interest in creating playful, visually engaging user experiences.
